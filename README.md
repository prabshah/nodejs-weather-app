## JavaScript, NodeJS, Express Weather App

## Instructions

### To run the app locally
1. Install dependencies - it might take a while (!)
    ```
    $ yarn/npm install
    ```    
5. Checkout `http://localhost:3000` :D

## Approach

### Features
With the time given, I have chosen a combination of features and decided on how
the MVP should look like. I then followed agile development approach to develop the application.

With this application, users can:
- get the weather of their current city.
- get the weather of any city of their choice.

### Main frameworks and libraries
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express

### Application architecture
The frontend serves as an interface with the user. I aimed to achieve a simple yet
attracting and user-friendly design. I have used ejs templeting engine to to acheive the server-side rendering

The backend uses Node JS, Express JS to create a server and uses 'request', a simple Node.js module  for http cal, to communicate with the OpenWeatherMap Api

### Future improvements
I'd like to keep expanding this project to hone my existing skills, as well as
to explore new technologies.
